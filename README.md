# Tip Calculator Problem

## Objective
Create a program that calculates restaurant tips based on bill amount, service quality, and party size.

## Problem Description

When dining out, calculating the appropriate tip can sometimes be challenging, especially when splitting the bill among multiple people. Your task is to develop a program that helps users determine the tip amount and the total each person should pay.

### Requirements

#### Input
The program should prompt the user for:

1. The total bill amount (before tip)
2. The quality of service received (poor, fair, good, or excellent)
3. The number of people splitting the bill

#### Processing
The program should:

1 Determine the tip percentage based on service quality
  - Poor service: 10% tip
  - Fair service: 15% tip
  - Good service: 18% tip
  - Excellent service: 20% tip
    
2 Calculate the tip amount based on the bill and tip percentage\
3 Calculate the total amount (bill + tip)\
4 Calculate how much each person should pay (total รท number of people)

#### Output
The program should display:

1 The original bill amount\
2 The service quality and corresponding tip percentage\
3 The calculated tip amount\
4 The total amount including tip\
5 The number of people splitting the bill\
6 The amount each person should pay

#### Error Handling
The program should:

1 Validate that the bill amount is a positive number
2 Ensure the service quality is one of the accepted ratings
3 Verify that the number of people is a positive integer
4 Provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
